# RobloxPlaceSecurity

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This security does not exist anymore

## Description
This security was most likely for experimental features / features that only places owned by Roblox were intended to use.

## Information
- **Index:** 2

## Notes
- Any member under this security were changed to either [`LocalUser`](../01%20-%20LocalUser.md) or [`RobloxScript`](../03%20-%20RobloxScript.md) when `RobloxPlaceSecurity` was removed from the engine.
- [`InternalTest`](../60%20-%20InternalTest.md) can be thought of as today's version of this security.
