## Description
Fallback, members should not have this security.

## Information
- **Capability (speculation):** Unknown
- **Permission Id (speculation):** ? (assume there isn't one)

## Notes
- This security is most likely treated as a fallback for when a member's security was not set correctly. This should be visible from the API dump and the Full API Dump when/if it happens
