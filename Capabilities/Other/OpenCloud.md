# OpenCloud

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Limited Information, was added on Oct. 1st, 2024 in a preupdate.

## Description (speculation)
Used to restrict normal GameScript actions from accessing OpenCloud related Engine APIs, [`luau-execution-sessions`](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/beta-open-cloud-engine-api-for-executing-luau/3172185) as an example.

## Notes
[Luau Execution Sessions](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/beta-open-cloud-engine-api-for-executing-luau/3172185) are given this capability. Whether or not the identity of these will change from [`GameScript`](../../Identities/2%20-%20GameScript.md) is unknown at this time, waiting for RCCService to update to v645 to test.
