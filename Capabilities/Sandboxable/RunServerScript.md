## Description
Used for an internal action that handles the execution of scripts with their [`RunContext`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/enums/RunContext) set to `Server`.
Can be seen if `Instance.Sandboxed` is `true` on a `Script` with `RunContext` set to `Server` or `Legacy`.

Similar to [`RunClientScript`](RunClientScript.md)
