## Description
Used for some internal action that handles the execution of scripts with their [`RunContext`](https://create.roblox.com/docs/reference/engine/enums/RunContext) set as `Client`.
Can be seen if `Instance.Sandboxed` is `true` on a `LocalScript` or `Script` with `RunContext` set to `Client` 

Similar to [`RunServerScript`](RunServerScript.md)
